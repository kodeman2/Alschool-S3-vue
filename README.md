## An application that fetches data from the GitHub API and displays it on the page.

Create a new vue js application then using the GitHub API, fetch your GitHub repositories using this endpoint https://api.github.com/users/{{USERNAME}}/repos. show a page with a list of all your repositories on GitHub(the page should have some form of pagination). Then create another page showing data for a single repo clicked from the list of repos using nested routes. Make sure to implement a wildcard route to catch 404 pages. NB: Good UI and Designs are important.
